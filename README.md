# Definitive_Guide_to_SQLite
My process for adding a sqlite 3 server with an apache2 web server for the (virtualized) local SQLite server.

#### Starting out...
When I started this journey into being a more technical developer than working on the Sales and Design side.

People started telling me "Yeah sure I would do but nobody does it like that" which made me think going offroad from most best practices was a good idea, which is was. I found early high quality signal growth data that lead to my first contract with a Medical company.

The first few batches of results after we finished the clustering and basic regression issues with the amount of low hanging fruit was 20 times what we had planned for... and the project stalled out becaues we hadn't even thought there was this much opportunity.

When you learn that a few simple skills in IT can lead you into an amazing life you start to fall in love with the opportunity.

If I can offer you some advice while you read this, stick to your plan as you go in life and if you are pretty sure your plan is good then allow for most if not all changes in elevation.

Be aware of little hills you can go around with less effort but writing code or IT projects operate in an enviroment that is not unlike the old west.

Sometimes you will get into an area of the industry where nobody has ever done, and you don't have a 'go-to' person ready who can advise you so you need to build in a group of Mentors, a Mastery group.

What does this have to do with SQLite you might ask, well learning how to create, read, update or delete files as the 'CRUD' acronym implies sometimes you have to know the database better than anyone.

You need to have significant parts of it 'in your head', these parts are the ground level trunk and say 4 branches deep ready to go for an efficent use of the data to tell you where to place a table for quicker retriveal.

Ignore the critics who tell you that this is too hard and wire up the concept into your brain of this "code deals with a massive amount of information"

This is becomming a blog post and not documentation.

SQLite is a great tool for storing data when you want to have an in memory setup and since SQL is the lingua franca of data, well its also good practice.
